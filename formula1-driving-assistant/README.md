## 🎯 What Is This?

F1 Driving Assistant is an interactive tool that fetches real Formula 1 telemetry data and visualizes it in a way that helps sim racers learn:

- **Braking zones** — Where the pros hit the brakes and how hard
- **Acceleration zones** — Where to get back on the throttle
- **Corner analysis** — Entry speed, apex speed, exit speed, and gear selection
- **Racing line** — The exact path taken by the fastest drivers

Perfect for drivers wanting to improve in:
- F1 2024/25 (Codemasters)
- Assetto Corsa / ACC
- iRacing
- Any sim with F1 tracks

3. Pick a session (Qualifying, Race, etc.)
4. Select a driver or use the pole lap
5. Generate visualizations

#### Quick Test
```bash
python main.py --test
```
Runs a quick demo with 2024 Bahrain GP qualifying data.

#### Direct Mode
```bash
# Specific race and session
python main.py --year 2024 --round 1 --session Q

# Specific driver
python main.py --year 2024 --round 1 --session Q --driver VER

# Save to file
python main.py --year 2024 --round 1 --session Q --save output.png
```

## 🖼️ Visualization Examples

### Track Map with Driving Zones
Shows braking zones (red), acceleration zones (green), and full throttle sections (blue) overlaid on the track layout:

```
🔴 Red    = Heavy braking zone
🟢 Green  = Acceleration / throttle application
🔵 Blue   = Full throttle (100%)
🟣 Purple = Corner apex markers with gear info
```

### Telemetry Dashboard
Four-panel view showing:
- Track overview with highlighted corners
- Speed trace over lap distance
- Throttle & brake inputs
- Gear selection throughout the lap

### 🆕 Animated Lap Replay
Watch the lap unfold in real-time with our enhanced replay system:
- **F1 Car Icon** — Realistic car shape instead of a simple dot, rotating with the racing line
- **Live telemetry** — Speed, Gear, Throttle %, Brake %
- **Track Conditions Panel** — Weather (temperature, humidity, wind), tire compound with color-coded indicator, tire age
- **Driver Status Info Box** — Real-time updates showing:
  - 🚀 **FULL THROTTLE** — Flat out on the straights
  - ⬆️ **ACCELERATING** — Getting back on the power
  - 🛑 **BRAKING** — Heavy braking zones
  - ➡️ **COASTING** — Trail braking or lift-off
  - 🔄 **CORNER** — Mid-corner
  - ⬆️/⬇️ **GEAR UP/DOWN** — Gear change notifications
  - 🟢 **DRS ACTIVE** — When DRS is deployed
- **Corner Approach Info** — When approaching a corner:
  - Corner name/number (e.g., "Turn 1", "Turn 4")
  - Corner type: HAIRPIN, SWEEPER, 90 DEGREE, KINK
  - Speed class: HIGH SPEED, MEDIUM SPEED, LOW SPEED
  - Direction: LEFT ⟲ or RIGHT ⟳ with angle
  - Phase: APPROACH → ENTRY → APEX → EXIT
  - Speed targets: Entry/Apex/Exit speeds
- **Input visualization** — Throttle/brake bars updating live
- **Playback controls**:
  - `Space` — Play/Pause
  - `R` — Reset to start
  - `←/→` — Step frame by frame
  - `+/-` — Speed up/slow down (0.25x to 4x)
  - GUI buttons for Play, Pause, Reset
  - Speed slider for precise control

### 🆕 Ghost Car Comparison
Compare two drivers' fastest laps head-to-head with our new ghost comparison feature:

#### Track Analysis
- **Color-coded track sections** showing who is faster where:
  - Each driver's team color highlights sections where they are faster
  - Example: Verstappen vs Norris = 🔵 Blue sections (Red Bull) vs 🟠 Orange sections (McLaren)
  - Gray sections indicate equal pace

#### Comparison Summary Plot
Static analysis view with four panels:
- **Track Advantage Map** — Track layout colored by who's faster in each section
- **Speed Comparison** — Overlaid speed traces with shaded advantage areas
- **Gap/Delta Chart** — Running time delta over the lap showing where time is gained/lost
- **Mini-Sector Breakdown** — Bar chart of time deltas for each track segment

#### Animated Ghost Replay
Watch both cars race through the lap together:
- **Two F1 car icons** — Each in their team color racing simultaneously
- **Live gap display** — Real-time delta timer showing current gap
- **Gap visualization bar** — Visual indicator of who's ahead and by how much
- **Speed comparison** — Side-by-side speed readouts with delta
- **Sector-by-sector timing** — Mini-sector times updating as cars progress
- **Driver labels** — Color-coded labels above each car
- **Trails** — Different colored trails behind each car
- **Same controls as single-car replay**:
  - `Space` — Play/Pause
  - `R` — Reset
  - `←/→` — Step through
  - `+/-` — Adjust speed

#### How to Use
1. Select a session (Qualifying recommended for best comparison)
2. Choose any driver from the list
3. Select "👻 Ghost Car Comparison (2 Drivers)" from the visualization menu
4. Pick your two drivers to compare
5. Choose to view the static summary, animated replay, or both!

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjusting Zone Detection
In `data_loader.py`, you can tune the zone detection thresholds:

```python
zones = analyze_driving_zones(
    telemetry,
    brake_threshold=10.0,        # Brake % to count as braking
    throttle_full_threshold=95.0, # Throttle % for full throttle
    throttle_partial_threshold=50.0,  # Below this = coasting
    min_zone_points=5            # Minimum points for a zone
)
```

### Visualization Colors
Edit `COLORS` dict in `track_visualizer.py`:

```python
COLORS = {
    'braking': '#FF4444',        # Red
    'acceleration': '#44FF44',   # Green
    'full_throttle': '#4488FF',  # Blue
    'coasting': '#FFAA00',       # Orange
    'corner_marker': '#FF00FF',  # Magenta
    ...
}
```

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: Uses [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) library to download official F1 telemetry
2. **Zone Detection**: Analyzes throttle, brake, and speed data to identify driving zones
3. **Corner Detection**: Finds local speed minima to identify corners and their characteristics
4. **Visualization**: Renders track using X/Y position data, overlaying color-coded zones
